## Part A

## loop through all the runs
## loop through milliseconds per run
## calculate distance per time span button holding
## compare with record distance of run
## count up win possibilities
## multiply the win possiblities of all runs


## PartB

## Transform distance and time to one pasted integer
## and feed to the loop described in outline for PartA



## Result Loop

wins = zeros(Int, length(time_partB))

   for speed in 0:milliseconds
